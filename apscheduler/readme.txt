1. Introduction

This document describes how to use the FastAPI-based scheduler, which leverages the APScheduler library to provide robust scheduling capabilities within a FastAPI application. This scheduler allows you to execute tasks at specific times, intervals, or based on other configurable triggers. This reference will guide you through setup, configuration, usage, and deployment.

Purpose: [ Briefly explain why you created the scheduler. Examples: To automate data processing, run background tasks, send scheduled notifications, etc. Be specific. ]

Key Features:

Flexible Scheduling: Supports various APScheduler trigger types (date, interval, cron).

Asynchronous Execution: Leverages FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities for non-blocking task execution.

Easy Configuration: Configurable through environment variables and/or a configuration file.

Persistence: Supports persistent job storage using databases (SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, etc.). ( If applicable )

API Endpoints: Provides API endpoints for managing jobs (add, remove, list, pause, resume). (If applicable)

Error Handling: Robust error handling and logging for reliable task execution.

Integration with FastAPI: Seamless integration with your existing FastAPI application.

2. Setup and Installation

Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+

FastAPI

APScheduler

Uvicorn (or ASGI server of your choice)

(Optional) Database adapter (e.g., SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL, motor for MongoDB) - If you are using persistence
